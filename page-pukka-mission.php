				<p>The journey starts with the highest quality organic herbs, rich in natural oils, carefully sourced from across the globe. Our search for the very best growers has led us all over the world: across Europe, Africa, India, South-East Asia and Central America.</p>

				<p>In these beautiful places we have found herb farmers with a profound respect for and understanding of nature, the soil, and plants. Today, we’re blessed to be working with thousands of Pukka growers in over 20 different countries around the world.</p>

				<p>Once collected and dried, the herbs are then analysed in the Pukka lab to ensure they meet stringent quality standards before being expertly blended using the wisdom of India’s ancient health system, Ayurveda by our master herbsmith Sebastian Pole. This means that every Pukka herbal blend is created with its associated health benefits in mind.</p>

				<p>Translated simply as ‘knowledge of life’, Ayurveda (a Sanskrit term: Ayur = life, Veda = knowledge) is an ancient Indian holistic philosophy that shows how to live a healthy, wholesome and 
				more fulfilled life by balancing your mind, body and spirit.</p>

				<p>At the core of Ayurveda is you, the individual, and your unique set of physical, mental and spiritual characteristics – known as dosha in Ayurvedic practice</p>

				<p>By taking your dominant dosha(s), Ayurveda offers insights into which foods, herbs, and lifestyle activities will enhance the quality of your life, and which ones won’t; leaving you empowered to make choices that will protect your physical health, your mental balance, and your spiritual wellbeing. </p>
